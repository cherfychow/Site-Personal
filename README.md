### Bangka Theme
This theme is all about large, clear elements. Huge typography, almost full screen photos. No hiding the pretty things :) Features Freight and HK Grotesk typefaces with a Kelly Green and manilla envelope pink palette. Blog posts have split styling for landscape and portrait photos with blockquote-like captions (again, everything's large). The webfonts aren't included in this repo because they're not mine to put out there.
